# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets

This project involves analyzing tweets to classify the emotions expressed in them as negative, neutral, or positive. The dataset used consists of tweets, and the goal is to build a model that can accurately determine the sentiment of each tweet.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that classifies tweets into negative, neutral, or positive categories. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Key Points

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the tweet text, tokenization, and vectorization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the distribution of sentiments and the most common words in each category.
- **Model Training**: Training a sentiment analysis model on the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using various metrics.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the distribution of sentiments and the performance metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the entire project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For building and evaluating the sentiment analysis model.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks.
- **TextBlob**: For additional text processing and sentiment analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- `selected_text`: The text of the tweet.
- `sentiment`: The sentiment of the tweet (negative, neutral, positive).

## Project Structure

- `tweet_dataset.csv`: The dataset file.
- `sentiment_analysis.py`: The main script containing data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
- `README.md`: This readme file.

## Results

- Distribution of sentiments in the dataset.
- Model performance metrics such as accuracy.
- Example predictions for new texts.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of natural language processing techniques for sentiment analysis of tweets. The visualizations and performance metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy and areas for improvement.
